# Project Description
    This project aims in developing a web application that enables a user to create an account with the website,
    apply to jobs that he sees fit or even create a task for someone else to accomplish.

    Users who have already registered their accounts can login to check their applied jobs, tasks which they have posted or apply to new jobs.

# Getting Started with Create React App

    1. install node.js and npm.

    2. cd into Hireme.

    3. Run npm install.

    4. Run npm start.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### SERVER CONFIGURATION
The server or api is built with Flask Framework which is a python programming language framework for developing web api's.

## Getting started with flask.

 
    1. open command prompt or terminal
    2. run <ins>pip install virtualenv</ins>
    3. Navigate to the /server folder
    4. Run <ins>virtualenv venv</ins>. This will create virtualenv folder in the server folder
    5. To activate the virtualenv run <ins>venv/bin/activate</ins> (for linux distributions) <ins>venv\Scripts\activate<ins> (for windows os)
    6. To install the project requirements run <ins>pip install -r requirements.txt</ins> in the virtualenv
    7. To start the server run <ins>set FLASK_APP=app<ins> (windows os) <ins>export FLASK_APP=app</ins> (linux os)
    8. Start the server by running <ins>flask run</ins>
The server will start running on localhost port 5000, which is default.
